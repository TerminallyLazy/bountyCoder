# Cloud GPU Provider Deployment Guide

This guide provides instructions for deploying the Qwen 32B Coder API service on cloud GPU providers to meet the requirements of:
- Minimum performance of 30 tokens/second
- Scalability up to 10,000 users
- 3-month uptime guarantee
- Custom rate limits per customer

## Recommended Providers

We recommend the following cloud GPU providers for hosting the Qwen 32B model:

### Primary Option: RunPod

RunPod is our primary recommended provider due to:
- Specialized in AI workloads
- Flexible GPU options (A100, H100)
- Cost-effective for long-running services
- Supports Docker containers with pre-configured templates
- Easy scaling based on demand

### Alternative: Lambda Labs

Lambda Labs is our alternative recommendation due to:
- Competitive pricing for AI workloads
- Good performance for inference tasks
- Simplified deployment process
- Strong support for AI frameworks

## Hardware Requirements

The Qwen 32B model requires significant GPU resources to achieve the minimum performance of 30 tokens/second:

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| GPU | NVIDIA A100 80GB or H100 |
| Memory | 80GB+ GPU memory |
| Storage | 100GB+ SSD |
| Network | 10Gbps+ |

## Deployment Steps for RunPod

1. **Create a RunPod Account**
   - Sign up at [RunPod.io](https://www.runpod.io/)
   - Add payment method
   - Request quota increase for A100 80GB GPUs

2. **Prepare Configuration**
   - Use the provided `runpod-config.yaml` file
   - Update environment variables and secrets

3. **Deploy Using RunPod CLI**
   ```bash
   # Install RunPod CLI
   pip install runpod-cli

   # Login to RunPod
   runpod login

   # Deploy using configuration
   runpod deploy -f runpod-config.yaml
   ```

4. **Set Up Networking**
   - Configure the provided load balancer
   - Set up custom domain (optional)
   - Configure SSL certificates

5. **Configure Monitoring**
   - Access Prometheus at `https://<your-domain>:9090`
   - Access Grafana at `https://<your-domain>:3000`
   - Import the provided dashboards

## Deployment Steps for Lambda Labs

1. **Create a Lambda Labs Account**
   - Sign up at [Lambda Labs](https://lambdalabs.com/)
   - Add payment method
   - Request access to A100 instances

2. **Prepare Configuration**
   - Use the provided `lambda-labs-config.yaml` file
   - Update environment variables and secrets

3. **Deploy Using Lambda CLI**
   ```bash
   # Install Lambda CLI
   pip install lambda-cli

   # Login to Lambda
   lambda login

   # Deploy using configuration
   lambda deploy -f lambda-labs-config.yaml
   ```

4. **Set Up Networking**
   - Configure the provided load balancer
   - Set up custom domain (optional)
   - Configure SSL certificates

5. **Configure Monitoring**
   - Access Prometheus at `https://<your-domain>:9090`
   - Access Grafana at `https://<your-domain>:3000`
   - Import the provided dashboards

## Scaling Configuration

To support up to 10,000 users, we've implemented the following scaling strategies:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**
   - Auto-scaling based on GPU utilization and request rate
   - Minimum of 2 replicas for high availability
   - Maximum of 10 replicas to handle peak loads

2. **Load Balancing**
   - NGINX load balancer with least connections algorithm
   - Health checks to ensure only healthy instances receive traffic
   - Session affinity for consistent user experience

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Redis-based rate limiting
   - Custom limits per API key
   - Configurable through the admin dashboard

## Uptime Guarantee

To achieve the 3-month uptime guarantee, we've implemented:

1. **High Availability**
   - Multi-zone deployment
   - Automatic failover
   - Redundant instances

2. **Monitoring and Alerts**
   - Prometheus metrics collection
   - Grafana dashboards
   - Alert notifications via email and Slack

3. **Backup and Recovery**
   - Daily database backups
   - Automated recovery procedures
   - Regular health checks

## Performance Optimization

To ensure minimum performance of 30 tokens/second:

1. **Model Optimization**
   - AWQ quantization for faster inference
   - Optimized tensor parallelism
   - Efficient memory utilization

2. **Batch Processing**
   - Request batching for higher throughput
   - Dynamic batch sizes based on load
   - Priority queuing for premium customers

3. **Caching**
   - Redis caching for frequent requests
   - Memory-efficient cache policies
   - Automatic cache invalidation

## Cost Estimation

| Provider | Instance Type | Monthly Cost (per instance) | Estimated Total (3 months, 2-10 instances) |
|----------|---------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| RunPod   | A100 80GB     | $1,500 - $2,000            | $9,000 - $60,000                          |
| Lambda Labs | A100 80GB  | $1,400 - $1,900            | $8,400 - $57,000                          |

*Note: Costs are estimates and may vary based on actual usage and provider pricing changes.*

## Maintenance Procedures

1. **Regular Updates**
   - Schedule maintenance windows
   - Rolling updates to avoid downtime
   - Canary deployments for major changes

2. **Monitoring and Optimization**
   - Regular performance reviews
   - Cost optimization
   - Capacity planning

3. **Backup and Disaster Recovery**
   - Daily automated backups
   - Disaster recovery testing
   - Documentation of recovery procedures
